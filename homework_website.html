    <h2>And their music is even cooler!</h2>


    <p>I'm gonna go through some cool videogame OSTs (original soundtracks) that you should listen to.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3> Subnautica </h3>
            <p> This videogame about ocean survival has a soundtrack by Simon Chylinski that many have described as psytrance and psychedelic EDM, and it's not hard to see why. I love putting this on to study to because it makes me feel like I'm not tethered to this cruel Earth by homework assignments.</p>
            <p> Listen to the OST <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT9_-P7N950">here</a>!</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> Undertale + Deltarune </h3>
            <p> These games and the music were all composed by one man who goes by Toby Fox. All of it is chiptune, and the bossfight music is legendary, including the track Megalovania that became a meme a while ago. These soundtracks have a little bit of everything and are musically very intricate and clever with cool leitmotifs.</p>
            <p> Listen to the OST of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpJl5XaLHtLX-pDk4kctGxtF4nq6BIyjg">Undertale</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRBSqEnTV8w">Deltarune</a>!</p>

            <h3> Cuphead </h3>
            <p> This videogame is stylistically a masterpiece. Cuphead is a game made in the rubberhose style of the 20's and 30's when Disney was only a small studio and was beating out competition of the likes of Fleischer. The music by Kristofer Maddigan is similar, taking inspiration from the aggressive swing and jazz style of the era. Every track is a love letter to that era and so fun to listen to! </p>
            <p> Listen to the OST <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL6uzgw_ifg">here</a>!</p>

        <li>
            <h3> Discworld - The Trouble With Dragons </h3>
            <p> This one is kind of niche. Made in the 90's, this PC game is made by LucasArts and is based on the Discworld books by Terry Pratchett. I was pleasantly surprised to find the soundtrack by Rob Lord online cause I loved the game so much (I downloaded the ScummVM emulator). </p>
